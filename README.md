# blackjack_sim


## Use
This program can either be used by changing values in the yaml files inside the blackjack/config folder, or by running the GUI. The command line program is run by running the main.py file inside the blackjack folder and the GUI is started by running the main.py file inside the outer folder. 

The custom bet spread is used when the spread_name variable is set to custom. Otherwise, it uses one of the predetermined spreads in the spread.yaml file. The custom spread is always saved to the spread.yaml file.
